Info For The Player


PLATFORMER:
	-Pogo feature that doubles as a block
	-Sling a crystal arm down to pogo
	-If holding the pogo action/do not properly pogo
	 instead slide on that surface in "blocking" state
	-This should automatically act as "slide" state if
	 not attempting to pogo
	:
		-Hold action = Block
		-Hold "down" + tap action = Pogo (surface dependant)
		-"Dash" + action OR (airborn) hold direction + action = Slide



MAZE:
	1) When walking at an area in the maze, permanently show that section
	2) Only show maze within eyesight, never past walls
	-Either way, I'm not sure yet
